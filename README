Build note:
Important note: As of the writing of this README (Monday July 6th 2009) youuseweb depends on the absolute latest version of plt-scheme (namely the one pulled form svn)
This is necessary for:
	* imagemagick fixes
	* servelet-env fixes
You can find instructions for checking out and  installing the SVN version of plt-scheme on http://svn.plt-scheme.org/
It may be possible to work around these issues with an older version if you wish by using the svn collects version, but no gaurantees.
